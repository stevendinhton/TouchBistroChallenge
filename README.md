# TouchBistro Full Stack Challenge - Steven Nguyen

An express server and react frontend for finding the median prime number(s) of the set of prime numbers less than n.
The express server has one route for returning an array of median prime numbers.
The react frontend makes requests to the express server.

### Running Express Backend and React Frontend 

Run ```npm start``` in both the `/frontend` and `/backend` directories.

### Running the tests for frontend and backend

Run ```npm test``` while in the `/frontend` directory to run the frontend tests and while in `/backend` to run the backend tests.
The command is the same for both again. 

Supertest and Mocha were used for testing the express server. 

Enzyme and Jest were used for testing the react frontend.
